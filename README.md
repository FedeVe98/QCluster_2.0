Clustering of Long Noisy Reads

Long reads can be quite noisy, and quality values are used to detect wrong bases.
Q-cluster is a tool to cluster short reads based on k-mers and quality values, here the code:
https://github.com/CominLab/QCluster
The idea is to extend this tool to be able to handle larger values of k,
and test its effectiveness as in this paper.
